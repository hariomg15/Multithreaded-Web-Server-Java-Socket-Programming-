# 🌐 Multithreaded Java Webserver

This project demonstrates a **basic web server** built using Java, supporting multiple client connections through different threading models:

- 🔁 **Single-Threaded**
- 🧵 **Multi-Threaded**
- 🧶 **Thread Pool-Based**

> Ideal for learning how socket programming and multithreading work in Java.
